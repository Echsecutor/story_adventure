# Story Adventure

This is a minimalist framework for writing / playing through (non-linear) stories.

## Inductive Introduction

Let's introduce the basic idea by a few examples.

A **Story Adventure** is primarily a set of **Sections** together with a **State** representing the current (initially the starting) state.
The [example story](editor/example_story.json) demonstrates the format.

## Acknowledgment
