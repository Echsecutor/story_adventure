## Introduction

Have a look at the [example story](stories/example_story.json) to see the format.

A **Story Adventure** is primarily a set of **Sections** together with a **State** representing the current (initially the starting) state.
The **State** can also hold variables that you can set initially (e.g. for consistent naming of entities) or change during the game.

**Sections** links to each other via **Choices** in the `.next` array of each section. Sections without choices are terminal.
Sections can also contain **Media**, with a type (image/video) and the link to the src. This can also be embedded as a data link.
Embedding Media has the advantage of creating an all-in-one file, but the obvious disadvantage of creating large files with inefficient encoding of binary data.

**Choices** may contain a description which is then actually displayed as a choice when playing through the adventure.
If you leave the description empty, it is just a "next" type button to break long sections into readable chunks/change grafics. You likely do not want to do this if there is more then one choice.

## Editor

Using [the editor](./editor/) you can write your own story adventures by providing text and media for each section and linking the sections by choices.
